">You can’t have light without dark. You can’t know happiness unless you’ve known sorrow. “Let your heart be your guide. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts – but you have to build the framework first.” Go out on a limb – that’s where the fruit is. Don’t fiddle with it all day. You’ve got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen.</p>
<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<p>Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. Here’s something that’s fun. It’s a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. &nbsp;You don’t have to spend all your time thinking about what you’re doing, you just let it happen.</p>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<p>This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life – to be able to share this with you. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy.</p>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<p>Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. If I paint something, I don’t want to have to explain what it is. Only eight colors that you need. Isn’t that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast?</p>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<p>Here we’re limited by the time we have. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. If you’ve been in Alaska less than a year you’re a Cheechako. Very easy to work these to death. Work on one thing at a time. Don’t get carried away – we have plenty of time.</p>
<h5>Heading 5</h5>
<p>Here we’re limited by the time we have. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. If you’ve been in Alaska less than a year you’re a Cheechako. Very easy to work these to death. Work on one thing at a time. Don’t get carried away – we have plenty of time.</p>
<p><strong>Bulleted List</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe there’s a happy little Evergreen that lives here.</li>
<li>Each highlight must have it’s own private shadow.</li>
<li>You have to make almighty decisions when you’re the creator.</li>
<li>Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They’re not all perfectly straight.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Numbered List</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Not every limb is perfect.</li>
<li>That’s a son of a gun of a cloud.</li>
<li>Just make little strokes like that.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Block quote</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>I get carried away with this brush cleaning. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. Now, we’re going to fluff this cloud. There’s not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Left justified</strong></p>
<p>Let’s put some happy little clouds in our world. You don’t have to be crazy to do this but it does help. The very fact that you’re aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you’re alive and can experience it.</p>
<p><strong>Center justified</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">It looks so good, I might as well not stop. How to paint. That’s easy. What to paint. That’s much harder. I’ll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red.</p>
<p><strong>Right justified</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: right;">Mix your color marbly don’t mix it dead. This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em’ on canvas. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. You’re the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You’re special. You’re so very special.</p>
